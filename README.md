# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline implementation using GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deployment processes.

## Features
- Automated build and test execution on push and pull requests
- Deployment automation to staging/production environments
- Linting and code quality checks
- Support for multiple workflows (e.g., testing, deployment, notifications)
- Versioning and release management

## Technologies Used
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Programming Language**: Python (or applicable language)
- **Testing**: Pytest / Unit tests
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure (depending on setup)
- **Linting**: Flake8, Black (for Python projects)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository access
- Git installed locally
- GitHub Actions enabled for the repository
- Cloud provider credentials (if deploying)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DilshanAberathna/CI-CD-Pipeline_github-Actions.git
   cd CI-CD-Pipeline_github-Actions
   ```
2. Configure GitHub Actions workflow:
   - Update `.github/workflows/main.yml` as needed.
   - Ensure required secrets (e.g., API keys, credentials) are set in GitHub repository settings.
3. Push changes to trigger workflow:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Monitor workflow execution under GitHub Actions tab.

## Usage
1. Modify the code and push changes.
2. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
   - Run tests
   - Perform linting
   - Deploy if all checks pass
3. Verify deployment on the target environment.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes.
